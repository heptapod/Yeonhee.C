    <div class="section-label">A</div>
    <h2>Personal Introduction</h2>
    
    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>I am a practice-based researcher and XR developer with lived experience of Complex PTSD (CPTSD) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). During the COVID-19 pandemic in London, I experienced firsthand the gaps in NHS mental health services—long waiting times, limited accessibility for neurodivergent individuals, and inadequate support for those not presenting with immediate self-harm risks.</p>
    
    <p>This project emerges from that lived experience, adhering to the principle that meaningful solutions for marginalized communities must come from within those communities themselves, rather than being designed "about us, without us."</p>
    
    <h3>Skillset</h3>

    <h2>Project Concept & Brief Response</h2>
    
    <div class="project-overview">
      <h3>Project Overview</h3>
      <p><strong>Wish You Were Here</strong> is an affordable, accessible AR application designed to provide immediate mental health support for individuals with PTSD, CPTSD, and sensory-sensitive neurodivergent conditions. The project responds to critical gaps in current mental health services by offering a tangible, hybrid XR experience that combines virtual companionship with physical comfort.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Core Innovation:</strong> Users interact with a semi-transparent 2D animated companion overlaid on a physical object (heated water bottle) through their smartphone camera, creating a "hybrid reality" that provides both visual and tactile comfort without requiring expensive VR equipment.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
    <p>Traditional mental health services often fail individuals experiencing trauma-related hypervigilance, panic attacks, and social isolation—particularly during crisis periods when immediate support is needed but emergency services are inappropriate. Current VR solutions are expensive, inaccessible, and often overwhelming for trauma survivors.</p>

    <h3>Solution Approach</h3>
    <p>This project develops an affordable alternative using existing technology (smartphones + common household items) to create safe, controlled therapeutic experiences. The design prioritizes accessibility, affordability, and scalability while maintaining therapeutic efficacy through evidence-based approaches to trauma-informed care.</p>

public class StereoscopicRenderer : MonoBehaviour {
    [SerializeField] private Camera leftEyeCamera;
    [SerializeField] private Camera rightEyeCamera;
    [SerializeField] private float eyeSeparation = 0.064f; // Average IPD
    
    void Update() {
        Vector3 leftPos = transform.position - transform.right * (eyeSeparation / 2);
        Vector3 rightPos = transform.position + transform.right * (eyeSeparation / 2);
        
        leftEyeCamera.transform.position = leftPos;
        rightEyeCamera.transform.position = rightPos;
    }
